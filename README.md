# Open-Dialer

Custom Dialer Application in Android.

1. The App user types a number or name in the interface.

2. Now the app will look for a phone number embedded in the text typed by the user.

3. If a phone number conforming to a phone number format is found, the app opens a dialer window with that phone number showing in the corresponding window. The user may or may not decide to dial the number.
